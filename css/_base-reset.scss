/* Creating white space (vertical gutters) via padding
 * most authors do not set right/left padding or margin on these elements, they rather use an extra wrapper or style the container with padding to create the left and right gap/gutter they need
 * I find that the latter creates less robust layouts because it leads authors to mix padding with width which creates issue with the broken box model (IE5 or IE6 in quirks mode) 
 * so imho, setting this style using the child combinator (i.e., div > h1) should be the best way to do it, but unfortunately IE 6 does not support such syntax, so I have to go with the following + a reset (see next rule)  

h1,
